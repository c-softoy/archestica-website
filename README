Hello Stendhal Admin.
This document guide you about how to setup a Linux box to make Stendhal website 
works together with your stendhal server, so your players can visualize pretty stats
and get interesting stats about game.

### Getting Apache, PHP and MySQL (LAMP)

I am assuming you have php installed. I am assuming your apache server knows how
to deal with php. You might not have php5-mysql installed, you need that too.
You can install them by writing:
  
  apt-get install apache2 php5 php5-mysql mysql-server mysql php5-gd php5-imagick


### Getting Stendhal Server

Also I assume that you already have a stendhal server set up, with a database 
created for the game.
The stendhal website connects to the stendhal game database to get up to the 
minute game data.


### Configuring

First of all copy configuration.default.php to configuration.php

###### MySQL

You will need to edit configuration.php with the username, pw and db name of the 
stendhal game db on your system. 
You won't have a stendhal website db yet.
So log in to mysql: 
  
  mysql -u NAME -p (you may need to be root to create databases!)

And write there this:

  create database stendhal_website;
  grant all on stendhal_website.* to 'FOO'@'localhost' identified by 'BAR';

Check the username, pw and database name again match those for the website
database in configuration.php.

Now in the stendhal_website directory run the command  

  mysql stendhal_website -u FOO -p <stendhal_website.sql 

Enter the password when prompted. 
It should return silently. It has some example news items and events in it already 
so I guess if you don't like them, edit them first!

###### Postfix
You need postfix to send emails to remind passwords.
Just do:

  apt-get install postfix

Configure it so that you have a valid hostname for it.
Then edit your php.ini file so that:

  ; For Unix only.  You may supply arguments as well (default: "sendmail -t -i"). 
  sendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i

When you install postfix it should create the appropriate link in /usr/bin.

If you are using Windows you need ot setup a SMTP and configure the php.ini to point
to there.

###### Stendhal data
Create a link to stendhal/data folder or copy it here so website knows how to access
stuff like sprites, items, configurations, etc...

###### Cache
In order to avoid expensive queries to database and complex XML parsings, 
ACP can be used for caching.

###### Communication with the game server

In order for the website to communicate with the server, you have to
define the following configuration settings:

define('STENDHAL_MARAUROA_SERVER', '127.0.0.1');
define('STENDHAL_MARAUROA_PORT', 32160);
define('STENDHAL_MARAUROA_CREDENTIALS', '<something random>');

And in server.ini:
proxy_credentials=<something random>

The credentials are used for authentication, so make sure that you put
something random in there. It needs to be the same value in both
configuration.php and server.ini

###### Extra tips

To edit news and events, login with an account from the game server with adminlevel >= 400 
to the website (top right) and edit the news and events using the GUI.
To allow people to upload screenshots you need to chmod a+w on your screenshots directory. 

  chmod a+w screenshots

You should probably deactivate magic quotes to avoid double escape of quotes.
Open /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini (well, that's where it lives for me!) and search for magic_quotes. 
Turn them off.
